<p>
  I'll say it right up front. I believe that the things we know about and understand profoundly shape and inform what we can imagine. This is why I think knowing about and understanding technology is so utterly critical for people working in nonprofits, social services, and other non-tech focused areas.
</p>
<p>
  If you work in a nonprofit, social services, or any other non-tech industry and you want to help people and make an impact on your community, you've probably already thought about how technology could help you do that better.
</p>
<p>
  If you're anything like me, you're probably pretty good at projects that require human or social-system engineering; maybe even better than with projects that require more technical implementation.
  "But, hey" you think, "that's no problem! "I can coordinate, support, and inspire the humans who do the tech implementation! Voila! World changing impact!"  ... Except for one problem.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The things we know about and understand profoundly shape and inform what we can imagine.</em>
</p>
<p>
  So how do you take your deep knowledge and understanding of social problems and apply tech solutions effectively? And, how do you work with the tech people who don't understand the social problems you are trying to solve?
</p>
<p>
  I can't tell you how many times I have had to try to explain the reasons for strict user confidentiality in apps that aspire to serve vulnerable populations - to name just one example.

<h4>The Facebook vs Spreadsheets Problem</h4>
<p>
  Not understanding technology causes a type of problem I like to call the "Facebook versus Excel Spreadsheet Problem".  This problem arises when non-technical people who have little or no understanding of technology try to imagine technical solutions to problems.

  <p>
    Most of these people that I talk to know quite a lot about social media and Excel or google spreadsheets and they struggle to imagine solutions outside of that scope.

  Before you disagree with me, let me explain a bit further.
</p>

<p class="blog-inpic">
  <img src="/assets/images/facebook-vs-google.png" alt=""> Both Facebook and Exel or Google Spreadsheets are extremely common apps that are created with the efforts of hundreds of developers and millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
  While Facebook is in an enormous, complex app with a highly networked and integrated structure, Excel and Google spreadsheets are as easy to set up, customize, and use as email.
</p>
<p>
  They represent two enormous extremes in terms of implementation complexity.
</p>
<br class="clear">
<p>
  For every techie I have to explain the challenges of of working with vulnerable populations to, I have spoken with as many non-techies who are really excited about tech-solutions that are either a re-creation of some portion of Facebook, or could easily be accomplished with an Excel or Google spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
  What I want to impress upon you is that there is a whole world of possibilities you miss when you only know about social media and Microsoft office.
</p>
<p>
  This matters for another reason. Maybe you've tried to implement an idea or solution and ran into problems. You probably went to someone who knows technology for help.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Here's my question for you:</strong> How did it go? Were you able to explain your problem and what you were trying to do? Did you end up with the technical solution you actually wanted?
</p>
<p>
  If your experience is anything like mine, it was at best, a very mixed bag of results.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine what it would be like if you could understand just enough about the technology you are trying to use or the technological options you are evaluating for a particular problem that you could communicate what you actually need and want. How great would that be?
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, in order to be able to talk about how a specific technology will help solve a given social problem, you have to cultivate enough tech literacy to be able to explain the solution to someone implementing it.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, without the ability to speak just a little tech, you are left trusting technological implementors to make choices about tools and methods who may not have sufficient understanding of the problem to make the best choices.  I see the results of this very worrying knowledge gap every time I see yet another poorly implemented, built, or maintained technology within a nonprofit.

</h4>
<p>
  I think we will look back and compare tech literacy today to actual literacy in earlier moments of our history.
</p>
<p>
  At the turn of the 20th century, the ability to read changed peoples life prospects in dramatic and very tangible ways.
</p>
<p>
  Today, understanding even the basics of the Internet, query languages, databases, and software applications can change a person's life in significant ways.

  My goal in sharing this is to help people solving social problems learn enough tech to comfortably engage in decision making and more effectively implement technological solutions.
