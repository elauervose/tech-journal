          <h3>This page is showing you a specific type of error that just happened. <br>
          The error has a numerical code, or "HTTP status code"  - this one is a "404 Page Not Found Error".</h3>

            <h4>
              An HTTP status code is how the Web server communicates to your Web browser what has happened.
            </h4>
            <h4>
              To understand the message being communicated, you have to look up the code number.
            </h4>
            <p>
              I remember the first time I realized this was actual information I could use to solve an internet problem and not just a confusing annoyance. <br>
              I'm no HTTP code wizard, but I can google a code and get at least some idea of what is wrong and then use that to figure out what the next steps are. <br>
              You should give it a try!
