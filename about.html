        ...and, of course, do this without necessarily having to make a full nerd-conversion complete with [fill in your favorite nerd stereotype here].

        In this blog, I'll share with you how I got started and what I learned along the way. My goal is to help you (even if you're uncertain or nervous about technology) explore concepts, try things, make things, and figure out how to make technology your very helpful friend and ally.
      </p>
      <h4>This blog will focus primarily on web-based technologies</h4>
      <p>
        This focus is partly because I have to limit the scope somewhere, and partly because I think web technology is a phenomenal and incredibly powerful equalizer.

          You can transform your world using web technology without having to use the newest and most expensive gadgets and whatnot. Obviously, there are some minimum hardware requirements to get into web technology, but I will do my best to minimize these challenges for you.

        To clarify just a bit more, when I say "web technology", I mean the things that make up the internet like web pages, HTML, servers, data, coding, URLs, security issues, and so on.
      <br>
        You won't find very much info here about how to use things like Twitter or Facebook because, in my experience, too much "how to use technology" info for nonprofits focuses almost exclusively on social media. In my mind, social media isn't technology - it's social media. Certainly, it <em>uses technology</em>, but it isn't what I mean when I say "technology".
