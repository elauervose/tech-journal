      <p>
        I currently work at a large-ish tech company and do tech education on a wide range of topics. People who have known me a long time are often surprised because I wasn't anything close to technically inclined until very recently.  Before I really learned to understand technology, I used to get full-on panic attacks when faced with a technical problem. It took me years to get to a place where I could take a deep breath and just analyze my problem.
      </p>

        Now, when I run into a problem, I know how to google it and try a few solutions, document my efforts and then hand it over to a more experienced techie with enough information to get it fixed right away (usually). Sometimes, I even fix the problem myself!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, in large part, because I've been so incredibly fortunate to have many brilliant, kind, socially engaged techies in my life who showed me that technology doesn't have to be so mysterious or inaccessible, or even expensive and luxurious.
      </p>

        Though, of course, it would be delusional of me to say that technology isn't part of a very privileged world view and socio-economic status. It is just as true that technology is becoming less a part of privilege and more a fact the modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest difference between me now and me then is that I see technology as a fun tool rather than a frustrating adversary.
      </p>
      <h4>I believe tech education is about empowering others to transform their lives.</h4>
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>
          My tech transformation really began after getting my masters in public administration and nonprofit management. I began thinking about how technology could help so many nonprofits expand their reach and impact to benefit communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, when I tried, I often ran into entirely non-technical problems having to do with attitudes about tech. I even began to suspect some of my classmates of being secretly proud of being a "non-techie".
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          <em>My goal with this blog is to help make technology a fun tool for people like me who haven't had all the support and help I have.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I want to help you feel like using technology to do what you do better is possible.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <br class="clear" />
      <p>
        So I set out to try to understand the tech world better in hopes that I could be an educational resource and a point of access to tech knowledge for other non-techies in hopes that I could not only change how they use technology, but also how they think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've read this far already, you probably aren't someone who needs convincing of the value of technology (or you're my mom who will read everything I write because your a mom), so I'm going to say right now that I hope you'll tweet me your feedback, ideas, and questions. I promise to do my very best to help you out or find someone who can! (my twitter handle is @elauervose).

        I'm proud to be able to say that I've spent most of my life in the nonprofit world and come from a family of social workers teachers and social minded idealists who sincerely care about helping people.  I started down this technical path after numerous frustrations with inadequate archaic technology in almost all of the nonprofits I've ever worked for.
